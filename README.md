Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Models

In my first project, where I used logistic regression, one of the supervised learning (classification) algorithms, I analyzed the dataset. I compiled the data to fit the model. I reduced the size by scaling the data. Finally, I created my model on the data set by dividing it into train-test set. I evaluated the model with metrics such as confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, f1 score.

In my second project,I used K-Means,on of the unsupervised learning (clustering) algorithms.I analyzed the dataset. I used MinMaxScaler() as feature scaling.I compiled the data to fit the model.I applied The Elbow Method to find out which classes are best.According to the dataset, the ideal number of clusters is 10, but I obtained an accuracy of 1.99%. I decided that this model did not fit the dataset.

Since this algorithm does not fit the dataset, we could not get a suitable result.

Also, supervised learning algorithms learn better from labeled data, our dataset consists mostly of labeled data. That's why it didn't work well in the unsupervised learning algorithm.

Since we ran the algorithm on large data (1 million), it was quite late and costly. Therefore, instead of this process, we can perform faster and less costly operations with direct classification algorithms.

We can even get a better result with a deep neural network model.
