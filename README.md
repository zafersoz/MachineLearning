Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Models

In my first project, where I used logistic regression, one of the supervised learning (classification) algorithms, I analyzed the data set. I compiled the data to fit the model. I reduced the size by scaling the data. Finally, I created my model on the data set by dividing it into train-test set. I evaluated the model with metrics such as confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, f1 score.

In my second project,
